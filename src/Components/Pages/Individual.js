                Whether you want to speak Czech when you travel to the Czech Republic,
                or you want to communicate with your partner, relatives, and friends, 
                I tailor lessons to your needs and interests.<br/><br/>

                Classes are interactive and fun. I focus on conversational Czech and 
                developing listening and speaking skills. I spend a lot of time practicing 
                pronunciation with my students so they feel confident speaking. We talk 
                about various topics. I write up dialogues that serve as an inspiration 
                to talk. We usually practice pronunciation, conversation, vocabulary, 
                sentence structure, and grammar in every session.<br/><br/>

                Students gain confidence in speaking with native Czech speakers when they 
                visit the Czech Republic. They learn the proper pronunciation, vocabulary 
                and grammar that enable them to carry on a conversation. They get a solid 
                overview of language structure and are able to converse on many subjects.<br/><br/>

                I am based in Seattle in the state of Washington in the United States. I 
                can meet people face to face in Seattle. For those who live outside the 
                Greater Seattle area, I offer distance instruction online via Skype and 
                email and over the phone.<br/><br/>

                I greatly enjoy working with people on an individual basis and in small 
                groups. Teaching is my passion and I love to share my knowledge of my first 
                language with people.<br/><br/>

                I use the following textbooks with most of my students:<br/>
                Title: Cestina hrou (Czech for Fun)<br/>
                Author: Susan Kresin<br/>
                Publisher: McGraw-Hill Primis Custom Publishing<br/>
                ISBN: 0072455470<br/>
                Pages: 566<br/><br/>

                The book is very comprehensive and comes with 2 tapes. It was used as a textbook 
                at the University of Washington. You can purchase it on the Internet 
                (www.amazon.com).<br/><br/>

                Title: Czech Step by Step: A Basic Course in the Czech Language for English Speaking Foreigners<br/>
                Author: Lida Hola<br/>
                Publisher: Fragment<br/>
                ISBN: 8072004026<br/>
                Pages: 288<br/><br/>

                There is also a workbook that students find helpful:<br/><br/>

                Title: Cestina hrou Pracovni sesit (Czech for Fun Workbook)<br/>
                Author: Susan Kresin, Hope Subak-Kaspar<br/>
                Publisher: McGraw-Hill Primis Custom Publishing<br/>
                ISBN: 0070350132<br/>
                Pages: 212<br/><br/>

                In addition to using the above textbooks, I provide individualized handouts 
                based on what students need to learn and practice.
